# Advanced Git for Astronomers part 1: recap from GitForAstronomersIntro and git CLI
Welcome to the the first part of the "Advanced Git for Astronomers" tutorial!

With this repo, we will be exploring how using git through the Command Line Interface (CLI) relates to using a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) like GitKraken. This repository is an almost identical copy of the one we use in our 
introductory tutorial - it consists of a couple of files and branches that we will be using during the first part of 
the advanced course. We are using text files on purpose, in order to demonstrate how git a priori has nothing to do with
software development!

## Requirements for Git for Astronomers Intro:

1. Create a GitHub account:
  - go to https://github.com/
  - click on the link to "Sign up"
  - provide a username, email address and password and create your account
  - validate the confirmation email
  
2. Install GitKraken:
  - go to https://www.gitkraken.com/download
  - download the appropriate installer for your operating system
  - run the installation
  - when you open the app for the first time it will prompt you to sign in - use your GitHub account for this, and 
  the email you used to create your GitHub account
  
3. Install the Git CLI:
  - On **Windows**, you can use git CLI and conda easily through "Git Bash": https://gitforwindows.org/
  - On **MacOS**, run "git --version" in your terminal - either you already have git installed, or it will prompt you with instructions.
  - On **Linux**, see here how to install the git CLI: https://git-scm.com/download/linux
