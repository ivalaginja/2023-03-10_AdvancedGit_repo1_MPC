# GitForAstronomersIntro
Welcome to the "Git for Astronomers" intro tutorial!

This repository consists of a couple of files and branches that we will be using in this introductory git course with
GitKraken. We are using text files on purpose, in order to demonstrate how git a priori has nothing to do with
software development!
